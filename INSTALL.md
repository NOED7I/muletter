# Install ÂµList API

Three steps : Clone, Config, Deploy

## Clone, Config

First of all, you need to clone or download this repo.

If you want to use the internal E-mail submitter form (for example if CORS is not enabled with your cloud hosting), you must edit `config.js` or set the environment variable "title" (`process.env.title`) during deployment and define your mailing list title (default to null).

For a dedicated server or a VPS, go to [Avanced configuration](#advanced_config) section.

## <a name="advanced_config"></a> Advanced configuration (config.js)

`port (80 | 443 | ...)` is required and must be an integer. In development you can define it directly with the command `PORT=8080 npm start`.

`host` is optionnal but for some web hosting / PaaS an IP is required like Openshift Online (`process.env.OPENSHIFT_NODEJS_IP`). You can provide an empty host or simply comment it.

`https (false | true)` is optionnal. `false` or simply not defined is usually the best choice because most of web hosting / PaaS already provide https. If `true`, the app will automatically generate certificates with `openssl` and handle https. Note that openssl must be installed with this option.

`key` is optionnal and should be used only for development purpose. It disables the crypto auto-generation access key.
